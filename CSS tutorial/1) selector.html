<!--
Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules,
where number three has the highest priority:

Browser default
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Inline style (inside an HTML element)

Note: If the link to the external style sheet is placed below the internal style sheet in HTML <head>,
 the external style sheet will override the internal style sheet!
